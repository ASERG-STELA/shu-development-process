# Communication - Level 4

TODO:  
Communication in L4 is very incipience and we should focus on providing students the initial set of questions they should use to interrogate the received specs and clients.
* We will provide some guidance on the use of socratic questioning to interrogate the received specs, with some example of questions about project specifics
* We will also provide a template of meeting minutes

## 5. Socratic Questioning Technique
When you are thinking about how to ask questions, there is a technique that you can consider when thinking about how to format the questions  you ask, so you can get as much information as possible. The key to extracting relevant information is all about how you structure your questions. This section will cover a technique known as Socratic Questioning which will help give you a guide as to how you can go about formatting your questions.  

The socratic approach to questioning is based on the practice of disciplined, thoughtful dialogue. Socrates, the early greek philosopher/teacher, believed that disciplined practice and thoughtful questioning enabled the student to examine ideas logically and to determine the validity of those ideas. When using this technique in a teaching aspect, the teacher professes ignorance of the topic in order to engage in dialogue with the students. By doing this, the student develops the fullest possible knowledge about the topic.  

This technique is an effective way to explore ideas in depth. By using this technique, it promotes independant thinking and gives ownership of what you are learning. Higher level thinking are present when you are thinking, evaluating, debating, discussing, and analysing content using your own thinking process. These types of questions take practice since in some cases the structure promotes an entirely new approach.  

Some tips;
* Plan significant questions that provide meaning and direction to the dialogue
* Use wait time; Allow some time for the person you are questioning to respond
* Follow up on the responses you receive
* Ask probing questions
* Periodically summarise in writing key points that have been discussed  

### 5.1. Six Types of Socratic Questions
There are six types of socratic questions you can ask, which will solely depend on what you are asking the questions for, and what information you are aiming to extract. The six types along with some example questions you could use that match these types are.

* Clarification
  * Why do you say that?
  * How does this relate to the discussion?
  * "Are you going to include diffusion in your mole balance equations?"
* Probe Assumptions
  * What could we assume then?
  * How can you verify or dissaprove that assumption?
* Probe reasons and evidence
  * What would be an example?
  * What do you think
* Viewpoints and Perspectives
* Probe implications and consequences
* About the question  

It is important to know what you want to find out so you can ask the right questions about the right thing. The example questions above should give you some insight into what you need ask, dependant on what type of information you are aiming to find out.

- Understand the initial set of requirements in terms of desired functionality/attributes.
  - Meet the client
  - Read the specification
- Understanding the problem.
  - Define an initial set of requirements for the solution.
  - Identify what you understand
  - Identify things on which you need clarity  
    - What is the problem
    - Form it as a useful question - Socratic questioning?  
- The expected outputs are the initial set of functions/attributes of the system.
