TODO:  
Communication in L4 is very incipience and we should focus on providing students the initial set of questions they should use to interrogate the received specs and clients.
* We will provide some guidance on the use of socratic questioning to interrogate the received specs, with some example of questions about project specifics
* We will also provide a template of meeting minutes
