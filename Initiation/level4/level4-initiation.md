## 2. Introduction
The Initiation phase (sometimes referred to as the Initial Communication phase) is dedicated to understanding the objectives of stakeholders, and for the design and collection of requirements that help identify the expected software functionalities and quality attributes. 

## 3. Understand the Requirements
The requirements define what the system should do and how it should do it. It is important to first take a step back and think about the whole picture. What do you want your software to be able to do? The specifications help to define this, and understanding the expected direction and features from this document is extremely important when starting out. A software requirements specification is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the functionality the product needs to fulfill all stakeholders (business, users) needs.  

<!-- The process of understanding the initial requirements is known in some places as the Requirements Engineering Process which spans 4 subsections. It is the process of defining, ducumenting and maintaining your requirements, and is just a way of organising what you have for later use. -->

### 3.1. Meeting the Client
Meeting with your client will be the first step in the process of Initiation. This is where the client will talk to you about what they are wanting to develop, and they will want you to follow their requirements. These will be presented to you in the form of a specification document. 

### 3.2.. Software Specification
At the initial stage, you will have been given a set of requirements now in the form of the specification. This will define the expectation you need to follow in terms of how the system will perform, the inputs and outputs that are expected, what the program should do and who will be making use of it. It is important now for you to **read** this specification and start to think about the next steps you want to take. Don't worry if you are not sure of what to do at this point, once you've read the specification, this document will help guide you through the next stages you need to think about going forward.

## 4. Understand the Problem

### 4.1. Define an initial set of Requirements
When you understand the requirements of the project you are about to start working on, it's time to decide on the **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for that solution.

#### 4.1.1. Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the basic system behaviour. Essentially, they are **what** the system does or must not do and can simply be thought of as how the system will respond to inputs. These requirements usually define if/then behaviours or **conditions** and can include calculations, data inpt and other business processes. Functional requirements are features that allow the system to function as it was intended. Putting it another way, if these requirements are not met, then the system could grind to a halt when it is being used by an external user. They are the **features** of your product and should be thought of with the highest importance in the initial stages.

#### 4.1.2. Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define what the system does or must not do, they specify **how** the system should do it. These requirements don't have any impact upon the functionality of the system, hence the name. Even if these requirements are not met, the system will perform its basic purpose. The most important aspect of non-functional requirements, and why they are so important is **usability**. The non-functional requirements define the system behaviour, features and general characteristics that are important for the user experience.
How well you define and execute these non-functional requirements will determine how easy the system will be to use. This is a good way to judge your system performance as well, consider them **product properties** and maintain focus on **user expectations**.

### 4.2. Identification Stage
Once you have identified all of your requirements, you now need to.
* Identify what you understand
* Identify things on which you need clarity  

With this, you will be able to understand what you need to get clarity on and what you are happy with in terms of your understanding. At this stage you will have had your initial meeting with your client, but once you have understood and wrote down a set of requirements, it is a good idea to meet them again with a set of question you can use to obtain further understanding. To do this you need to think about what the problem is, and think about what kind of questions you need to ask to help you get clarity here. 

## 5. Socratic Questioning Technique
When you are thinking about how to ask questions, there is a technique that you can consider when thinking about how to format the questions  you ask, so you can get as much information as possible. The key to extracting relevant information is all about how you structure your questions. This section will cover a technique known as Socratic Questioning which will help give you a guide as to how you can go about formatting your questions.  

The socratic approach to questioning is based on the practice of disciplined, thoughtful dialogue. Socrates, the early greek philosopher/teacher, believed that disciplined practice and thoughtful questioning enabled the student to examine ideas logically and to determine the validity of those ideas. When using this technique in a teaching aspect, the teacher professes ignorance of the topic in order to engage in dialogue with the students. By doing this, the student develops the fullest possible knowledge about the topic.  

This technique is an effective way to explore ideas in depth. By using this technique, it promotes independant thinking and gives ownership of what you are learning. Higher level thinking are present when you are thinking, evaluating, debating, discussing, and analysing content using your own thinking process. These types of questions take practice since in some cases the structure promotes an entirely new approach.  
Some tips;
* Plan significant questions that provide meaning and direction to the dialogue
* Use wait time; Allow some time for the person you are questioning to respond
* Follow up on the responses you receive
* Ask probing questions
* Periodically summarise in writing key points that have been discussed  

### 5.1. Six Types of Socratic Questions
There are six types of socratic questions you can ask, which will solely depend on what you are asking the questions for, and what information you are aiming to extract. The six types along with some example questions you could use that match these types are.

* Clarification
  * Why do you say that?
  * How does this relate to the discussion?
  * "Are you going to include diffusion in your mole balance equations?"
* Probe Assumptions
  * What could we assume then?
  * How can you verify or dissaprove that assumption?
* Probe reasons and evidence
  * What would be an example?
  * What do you think causes this to happen? Why?
  * Do you think that the software is a cause for these issues in deployment?
* Viewpoints and Perspectives
  * What would be an alernative?
  * Why is this the best approach?
  * What are the strengths and weaknesses of ...?
  * How are ... and ... similar?
  * Would you explain why this is beneficial or neccessary? Who benefits?
* Probe implications and consequences
  * What are the consequences of that assumption?
  * What are you implying?
  * How could our results be affected if the software crashes?
* About the question
  * What was the point of this question?
  * What does ... mean?
  * How does ... apply to user requirements?
  * Why do you think I asked this question?

It is important to know what you want to find out so you can ask the right questions about the right thing. The example questions above should give you some insight into what you need ask, dependant on what type of information you are aiming to find out.
