## 1. Introduction

The planning phase is responsible for defining the scope of the project, the resources needed, the risks involved, a work schedule, and the resulting products.

This document provides some guidelines that can be used to help you in this phase.

## 2. Planning your work

These are some points to be considered as a general guidance when planning your work:

- Development process and tools
  - Communication tool
  - Project management
  - Version control
  - IDE and frameworks
  - Testing
- Team roles: In a group, determine who will play each role
  - Project Manager
  - Leading on Design
  - Overseeing coding
  - Leading Testing
  - Talking to the client
  - any other role
- Feature points
- Resource Management: What do you need to conduct the project? What do you already have?
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - Expertise
- Milestones
  - What are your deadlines?
- Risk assessment
  - What are the risks?
    - internal/external factors that may affect your team's ability to deliver the project.
  - How do you prioritise?
  - Can you mitigate them?

When planning your work you should try to adopt SMART planning:

- **S**: Specific
- **M**: Measurable
- **A**: Achievable
- **R**: Realistic/Relevant
- **T**: Time-related

## Level Specific Guidance

### Level 4

- [Communication:](team-communication/level-4/level-4-team-communication-guidelines.md) Informal
- [Project Planning:](project-management/level-4/level-4-management-guidelines.md) Basic work breakdown structure is maintained. Using a tool is nice.
- [Version Control](version-control/level-4-git-instructions.md) Basic version control for individual programs.

### Level 5

- [Communication:](team-communication/level-5/level-5-team-communication-guidelines.md) Scrum like meeting.
- [Project Planning:](project-management/level-5/level-5-management-guidelines.md) Work plan and allocation is done. Status is also tracked using some tool.
- [Version Control:](version-control/level-5-git-instructions.md). With basic branching. Nice to have basic DevOps implementation depending on module (e,g GSDP).

### Level 6

- [Communication:](team-communication/level-6/level-6-team-communication-guidelines.md) Scrum like meeting and ongoing communication through tools.
- [Project Planning:](project-management/level-6/level-6-management-guidelines.md) Work plan, allocation and status is tracked through some tool. Dependency and risks are managed.
- [Version Control:](version-control/level-6-git-instructions.md) With development/feature branch, main branch and integration branch (if applicable). Need to have a merging strategy. DevOps implementation.
