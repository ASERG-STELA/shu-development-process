## 3. What Is Expected

At Level 6, you will have completed many projects involving some form of group work, even if it is just two of you. You should have experience using at least one communication tool as well as some experience with the **Scrum** framework.
At this level, we expect you to use one of the following tools (preferably one of the top 5) in your projects:

It is also expected that you follow the Scrum framework (or something similar) and use it in conjunction with Kanban project managament. As a reminder, here is a diagram of the Scrum framework for you to follow. The framework is highlighted in detail in the [Level 5 Guidelines](/lifecycle/planning/team-communication/level-5/level_5_team_communication_guidelines.md):

![The Scrum Framework. By Scrum.org](/lifecycle/planning/team-communication/images/scrum-framework.png)
*Fig. 1: The structure of the Scrum framework. By Scrum.org.*

You should follow the Scrum framework whilst simultaniously communicating through one of the tools highlighted above when working remotely.
If you follow this guidance, you will have the correct structure for effective communication, which will help mitigate many of the problems and risks that might arise during software development.
