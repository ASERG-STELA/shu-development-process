## 1. Introduction

The analysis phase is dedicated to the formalisation of the requirements elicitation.
It will involve artefacts like user stories and use cases.

- Talking to a client  
- Documenting your Understanding  
- Sharing Ideas  
  - Group Work  
  - Individual Work
- What is a requirement?
  - MoSCoW
  - Identifying them
  - Documenting
  - Prioritising

## Level Specific Guidance

### Level 4 (TBD)

- Basic user stories identifying “the actor”, “the narrative”, and “the goal”.

## User Stories
A User Story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. We write these under the perspective of a potential end user of our system.  
At Level 4, the expectation of your User Stories will be to fulfil the basic criteria using the template of;

* As a
* I want to
* So that I can

Which enable us to identify "the actor", "the narrative" and "the goal".  
They are a useful tool to help us organise our understanding of the system and it's context.

### Level 5 (TBD)

- User stories should include basic indications of acceptance criteria.
- Use Case or User Story or Requirement Specification.
- Persona and User scenario.
- Requirements should be SMART.

## User Stories
A User Story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. We write these under the perspective of a potential end user of our system.  
At Level 5, the expectation of your User Stories will be to fulfil the basic criteria using the template of;

* As a
* I want to
* So that I can

Which enable us to identify "the actor", "the narrative" and "the goal".  
They are a useful tool to help us organise our understanding of the system and it's context.  
At Level 5, basic indications of <b>Acceptance Criteria</b> are required as well.

### Acceptance Criteria

Aceeptance Criteria is defined as 'what the story needs to do before it can be considered satisfactory'.
These follow the typical agile format of;

* Given
* When
* Then

Defining the required amount of detail to be included here varies based on your team, your project and program.  
Sometimes you may be expected to include what is known as <b>Predecessor Criteria</b>.  
You can also write your acceptance criteria in the form of bullet points, but communicate with your team and find out the way you want to structure them in advance.


### Level 6 (TBD)

- Well defined user stories with clear acceptance criteria, and evidence of traceability.
- end to end traceability (Requirement Traceability Verification Matrix) need to be maintained.

## User Stories
A User Story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. We write these under the perspective of a potential end user of our system.  
At Level 6, the expectation is that your User Stories are <b>well defined</b> and also fulfil the criteria using the template of;

* As a
* I want to
* So that I can

Clearly identifying "the actor", "the narrative" and "the goal".  
They are a useful tool to help us organise our understanding of the system and it's context.  
At Level 6, <b>Acceptance Criteria</b> is required.

### Acceptance Criteria

Aceeptance Criteria must be <b>clearly defined</b> as 'what the story needs to do before it can be considered satisfactory'.
These follow the typical agile format of;

* Given
* When
* Then

Defining the required amount of detail to be included here varies based on your team, your project and program.

### Requirement Traceability Matrix
This is a document that is used to demonstrate relationships between requirements and other artefacts.  
It is the ability to connect your requirements to other artefacts, such as different types of software tests or bugs. It's used to track requirements, and prove that requirements have been fulfilled.
