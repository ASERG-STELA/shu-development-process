# Software Development Process

## Introduction

We are creating a software development process that can be followed by
students at all levels as they work on both individual and group
assessments. We're doing this because we want our students to use good
practice, to undersatnd the software lifecycle and to become familiar with
industry-standard tools. We also want to develop a process that simplifes the
management and assessment of students' work.

### How do students use it

#### Group Work

- Communication
- Management
- Problem resolution
- Documentation

#### Individual work

- Tracking your work
- Documenting your work

#### Techniques

- Defined
- Highly recommended

#### Tools

- Suggested
- Use something

## Development Process

The core of this is a development process that uses a simplified software lifecycle.

The [process](lifecycle/README.md) includes:

- a process for doing an assessment task
- a process for managing a solo software development activity
- a way of managing software development in a group
  - where group members know each other
  - in a group of (relative) strangers
- a software development process

## Assessments, Reports and Presentations

The process will be more useful to our students if it fits into the
assessment of their work. The second part of this project is to define
structured ways in which students can present and submit their work. By
following a simple process, even those with poor study skills will be better
able to showcase their learning.
