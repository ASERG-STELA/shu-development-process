# Level 5 Delivery Guidelines

## 1. Abstract

This document will serve to provide Level 5 students with instructions on what you need to do for arguably the most important phase of the software development lifecycle. The Delivery of the product. At Level 5, along with submitting the README file located [here](../README-Template.md), some flavour of DevOps would also be nice depending on the module.

## 3. DevOps

At Level 5, some flavour of DevOps would be good to implement depending on the module. GSDP would be an ideal module to implement some DevOps practices.

## 3.1. What is DevOps

DevOps (Development Operations) is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably (reference [1]).
You may not think this is very applicable to you as students, but it is a good idea to learn some form of DevOps before you start your first development job after university, as companies will more than likely have some form of IT team that developers like yourselves will need to work with.

DevOps is not a thing, such as a piece of software or programming language, it is a culture; a set of practices to help improve software development enabling for rapid software release. It is made up of 8 main practices, which can be seen from this diagram:

![DevOps diagram](../images/devops-diagram.png)
*Fig. 1: DevOps practices. Retrieved from reference [2]*

This diagram shows the primary DevOps practices, as well as some popular tools that are often used during each phase. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. 
At this Level you should already be familiar with **Plan**, **Code** and **Build**. In this document, we will pay particular attention to **Release** and **Deployment**. These two phases are often called **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment** (CI/CD). We will now go into detail about these two phases. The CI/CD pipeline is one of the best practices for DevOps teams to implement, for delivering code changes more frequently and reliably.

## 3.2. Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. 
It allows developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are often used to assert the new codeâ€™s correctness before integration. At Level 5, using automated tools is not expected, but would be nice if you have the ability.

As you can probably guess, the backbone of a good CI pipeline/workflow is good version control management. Version control is also supplemented with other checks like automated code quality tests, and syntax style review tools. In Git (which you should be familiar with at this level), a CI pipeline can be implimented using an **Action**. I will demonstrate how to implement a Github Action later in the document.

CI is a valuable and well-established practice in modern, high performance software engineering organizations, therefore it is a good practice to learn, before you go out into the working world (reference [3]).

## 3.3. Continuous Delivery and Deployment

Coninuous Delivery (CD) is slightly different, but goes hand in hand with Continuous Integration. Continuous Delivery is essentially an extension of Continuous Integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. 
This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process where you can deploy your application any time. 

In theory, with CD, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business/user requirements. It is best practice to release as soon as possible, releasing in small, managable batches that are easy to troubleshoot if any problems arise.

Continuous Deployment goes one step further than Continuous Delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production (reference [4]). This is not expected at Level 5.

## 3.4. Setting up a CI Pipeline with Github Actions

I will now show a simple example of how to set up a CI pipeline using **Github Actions**, this example is a basic repository with a 'Hello World' C++ project in it. We will set up a CI pipeline that runs some basic automated tests when merging the **develop** branch with **master**. The CI workflow should be set up **before** you start development:

1. Go to your repository and select **Actions** from the nav bar:

![Navigate to Actions](../images/Actions-1.PNG)

2. You will see that there are many **Workflows** to chose from. Some are CI specific, some are deployment specific (CD). Find a CI workflow for whatever programming language you are using; .NET for C#, Pylint for Python etc. We will choose the recommended workflow **C/C++ with Make** for the C++ program we have in this example. Click **Set up this workflow**:

![Choose a workflow](../images/Actions-2.PNG)

This might look confusing. The only parts you should pay attention to at this stage is **on: push** and **on: pull_request**. The **jobs** section can be edited to include more tests, the basic version will be enough for us in this example and you shouldn't worry too much about changing this at Level 5. The **on:** section shows when the automated unit tests will run, in our example, they will run when pushing and merging on the master branch. 

3. Select the green **Start commit** button at the top, when you are ready. Fill in the fields then select **Commit new file**. The workflow should now be set up and a new .yml file created. You may need to navigate back to **Actions** to click **Enable actions**.

4. Now lets see it in action! Lets make a change in the project. So far, the project looks like this:

![Project before change](../images/Actions-3.PNG)

Now lets add an extra output, and commit the changes:

![Project after change](../images/Actions-4.PNG)

5. Create a new **Pull request** to merge **develop** into **master**:

![Create pull request](../images/Actions-5.PNG)

6. Navigate to the pull request, The workflow should now run and perform some automatic tests to check everything is in order. If so, this should appear:

![Workflow checks passed](../images/Actions-6.PNG)

7. If everything is in order, click **Merge pull request**. You can still merge if a test fails, but this is discouraged, and you should check the error to see what test failed and fix it before merging. If a test fails, it should output something similar to this: 

![Workflow checks failed](../images/Actions-7.PNG)

You can navigate to the **Checks** tab to see what caused the test to fail.

## 4. What is Expected

At Level 5, DevOps is not expected to be seen in all of your projects. In some modules such as GSDP however, it would be nice to see some basic DevOps such as a Continuous Integration pipeline. 
It is essential that you maintain good version control management in your GSDP module, and it would be nice to see a Github Action implemented for some basic automated testing. Manual communication should still be of high importance on this module, and during any of your other group projects.

Code should be pushed and merged in small batches frequently if you are following DevOps practices. If this is done in conjunction with automated tests in a CI workflow, you will impress your clients and your module leaders, and importantly, make for good quality code and releases.  

As well as this; as with Level 4, you should also complete and upload the README file located [here](../README-Template.md) with your submission.
