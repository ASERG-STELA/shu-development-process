## 1. Introduction

The code step concerns the implementation of the structures modeled in the design phase.

## Level Specific Guidance

### [Level 4](level4/level4-code-commenting.md)

- Code should have basic comments.
- Code reviews should be manual.

### [Level 5](level5/level5-code-commenting.md)

- Code should follow a coding standard and have basic documentation.
- Code reviews should be manual, using a tool would be nice.

### [Level 6](level6/level6-code-commenting.md)

- Should follow proper coding standards. Need to be consistent with design. Code should be properly documented and should have generated documentation like API doc (e.g., swagger) or Javadoc.
- A tool should be used, code coverage would be nice.
