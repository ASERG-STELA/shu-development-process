## 1. Introduction

The code step concerns the implementation of the structures modeled in the design phase. This phase is where development begins, and probably the main reason why you are on this course. Tutorials on how to code e.g. syntax of languages is not greatly covered in here, instead, good coding practices, good code comments, and how to do good code reviews are outlined and explained.

For guidance on coding standards on some languages you will likely encounter on the course (which should be adhered to in your projects as much as possible), visit either:

- [C#/C++ Coding Standards](coding-standards/c.md)
- [Java Coding Standards](coding-standards/java.md)
- [Python Coding Standards](coding-standards/python.md)
- [Web Development Coding Standards](coding-standards/webdev.md)

## Level Specific Guidance

### Level 4

#### [Code Commenting](level-4/level4-code-commenting.md)

- Code should have basic comments.
- Code reviews should be manual.

#### [Code Review](code-review/level-4/level-4-code-review-guidelines.md)

- Manual

### Level 5

#### [Code Commenting](level-5/level5-code-commenting.md)

- Code should follow a coding standard and have basic documentation.
- Code reviews should be manual, using a tool would be nice.

#### [Code Review](code-review/level-5/level-5-code-review-guidelines.md)

- Using a tool would be nice.

### Level 6

#### [Code Commenting](level-6/level6-code-commenting.md)

- Should follow proper coding standards. Need to be consistent with design. Code should be properly documented and should have generated documentation like API doc (e.g., swagger) or Javadoc.
- A tool should be used, code coverage would be nice.

#### [Code Review](code-review/level-6/level-6-code-review-guidelines.md)

- A tool should be used
