## 3. What Is Code Reviewing

Code review, sometimes called peer code review, is a quality assurance activity where one or more programmers will check some source code from another developer for any mistakes. This activity has been proven to accelerate and streamline the software development process. 

The argument might be made that there is no need to do code reviews if you employ comprehensive manual or automated Unit Testing, however, testing will only check if the program is functioning correctly, not that the programs' features are what they are supposed to be. This needs the human intervention in which a piece of software cannot determine.

## 3.1. Why is it Important

As previously mentioned, code reviews allow developers to spot mistakes in each others code. These mistakes could be anything from syntactic and compiler errors, to merge conflicts when you are looking to merge different branches in your Github repositories. 

Other developers in your team may be more likely to spot mistakes on your code than you are. You may need a fresh set of eyes of someone who has not seen your code before. Other than the obvious reason why it is important; to make sure a program is functioning correctly, it is also important for ensuring the code matches what is required by the client, which a software testing tool will not be able to tell you.

## 4. Types of Code Review

There are a few different ways you can conduct a code review, there is not really any right or wrong way to do it, as long as you determine if there are any mistakes in the code, and rectify them. Here are four common approaches, but you may find your own approach to be the best for you:

* The Email Thread
* Pair Programming
* Over-the-Shoulder
* Tool-Assisted

## 4.1. The Email Thread

This approach is simple. If you are struggling with something, or would like some code reviewing before pushing the changes to Github, you can email the changed file to your colleagues for them to review when their workflow permits. 
Although known as 'The Email Thread', you can swap email for any communication software that allows for file sharing, such as Discord, Microsoft Teams, Zoom or Google Drive.

This approach can be more flexible than the other techniques, an email thread of code reviews can quickly get complicated, and it depends on the workloads of your colleagues. If they are busy with other tasks and don't have the time straight away to review your code, it may get forgotten about, leaving you to either do the work yourself or having to use one of the other techniques.
