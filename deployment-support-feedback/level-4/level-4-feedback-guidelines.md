## 3. How You Will Be Assessed

Evaluation of your deliverable should not be overlooked. When you submit your deliverable, it is likely that at some point you will be asked to produce some form of evaluation of the product you submitted. This may take the form of one of the following:

* Reflective report
* Presentation
* Walkthrough

The main form of evaluation assessment that you will encounter at Level 4 will be reflective reports. Especially for your larger projects.

## 4. Why Evaluation Is Important

Evaluation is an often overlooked phase in the software lifecycle, however completing an evaluation can greatly improve the quality of the next product/project you are apart of.
Some of the benefits of evaluation include:

* Improves source code quality
* Improves communication and team work
* Clarifies outcomes
* Focuses attention of what went well, and what didn't go as well
* Supports ongoing learning
* Influences future developments

## 5. What You Should Evaluate

When undertaking your evaluation using any of the above, you should consider the following aspects:

* The solution:
  * How complete is it?
  * Does it work?
  * Is it maintainable?
  * Are you pleased with it?
  * Did you work well?
  * What problems did you encounter?
* User feedback
* Reflect and identify learning
* Refer back to:
  * Specification
  * The requirements you identified
  * Design decisions/models
  * Testing
* Your team:
  * Did you work well?
  * Did you encounter any problems?
  
## 5.1. What To Include In Your Reflective Report

Reflecting on the above, we expect you to evaluate the following in your reflective reports:

* Quality of the deliverable
* Assessment of your chosen methodologies
* Validation (refer to requirements, models, testing and user feedback)
* Discuss the case study in the context of your course (how you used knowledge you gained from the module and other modules)
* How well you worked as a team
