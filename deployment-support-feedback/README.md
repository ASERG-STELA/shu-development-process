## 3. Why Evaluation Is Important

Evaluation is an often overlooked phase in the software lifecycle, however completing an evaluation can greatly improve the quality of the next product/project you are a part of.
Some of the benefits of evaluation include:

- Improves source code quality
- Improves communication and team work
- Clarifies outcomes
- Focuses attention of what went well, and what didn't go as well
- Supports ongoing learning
- Influences future developments

## 4. How You Will Be Assessed

Evaluation of your deliverable should not be overlooked. When you submit your deliverable, it is very likely that you will be asked to produce some form of evaluation of the product you submitted. This may take the form of one or more of the following:

- Reflective report
- Presentation
- Walkthrough

## 5. What You Should Evaluate

When undertaking your evaluation using any of the above, you should consider the following aspects:

- The solution:
  - How complete is it?
  - Does it work?
  - Is it maintainable?
  - Are you pleased with it?
  - Did you work well?
  - What problems did you encounter?
- User feedback
- Reflect and identify learning
- Refer back to:
  - Specification
  - The requirements you identified
  - Design decisions/models
  - Testing
- Your team:
  - Did you work well?
  - Did you encounter any problems?

There are three main aspects that you should consider when undertaking evaluation through either a report, presentation or walkthrough:

- Structure
- What to Include
- What not to Include

## 6. Reports

A report is likely to be the most common form of evaluation/feedback assessment that you will encounter on this course. It is important to know what makes a good report, and the aspects that you should consider when writing your report.

### 6.1. Structure

A good report not only relies on what goes into it, it is also important to think about the structure of it.
Your report should be a joy to read, and should captivate the reader from the first couple of sections.
It should follow a clean, and well structured approach, with as little grammatical errors as possible.
The following are a selection of headers that you can cover in your report.
Your report does not neccessarily have to follow this exact structure, but it should give you some idea for what the structure of your project should look like:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation and Testing
- Evaluation
- References
- Appendices:
  - Screenshots
  - Design Documents

### 6.2. What to Include

Along with a solid, well built structure, you also need to know what you should include in your report. This should go hand in hand with the structure, and you should not stray away from your structure while writing your report.
Thinking about what to include in your report will be important in ensuring that you are on the right track with your development, and will assist you reaching the minimum word count. Here are some important aspects that you should consider including in your report:

- Quality of the deliverable.
- Assessment of your chosen methodologies.
- Validation (refer to requirements, models, testing and user feedback).
- Discuss the case study in the context of your course (how you used knowledge you gained from the module and other modules).
- How well you worked as a team.
- Explanations of why you did things.
- Your development process (design, implementation, testing etc).
- Your reflections and learning:
  - Your main achievements (what went well).
  - What could have been done better.
- A management-level overview of your work.

### 6.3. What not to Include

As well as what to include, it is also important to consider what you do not need to include in a report. This will reduce 'bloating' your report with unneccessary content which will keep your word count down and your report more concise. It will also ensure that you do not get side-tracked and begin talking about stuff that you do not need to as well as hemp keep your readers attention.
Here are two important details **NOT** to include in your report:

- Source code
- Details of every iteration that you went through

Source code may be acceptable if you are showing off or explaining a particular piece of code that you are proud off, however if you choose to do this, make sure that:

- If showing a code screenshot, make sure you are not using a 'dark' theme in the code editor, this takes the readers' eye towards the image rather than the actual explanation about why you are showing it
- If you copy the code directly, only copy a very small section of it, as it will bloat your report with unneccessary extra words. Also make sure it is formatted well, or else it will look messy.

## 7. Presentations

Presentations are another popular form of assessment, you will likely have to do a few of these throughout your course.
Presentations are usually created on PowerPoint or similar software, then presented as an individual or group to a client.

### 7.1. Structure

As with a written report, is is important to have a clear structure and flow to your presentations. A presentation that does not flow well will likely be hard to present, and will sound messy and ill-considered. As guidance, The following structure aspects could be considered when creating/presenting a presentation. You do not have to use this structure exactly, but it should give you an idea of what we are looking for:

- Brief introduction to yourselves
- Your understanding of the problem
- Your approach to the problem
- Software architecture
- Data and database
- The design of the interface
- An evaluation of your work (e.g., software testing, experiment, etc)
- A conclusion summarizing what went well and what not, with some indications of future work

### 7.2. What to Include

A presentation is about showing off your work, and you should aim to do just that. In a written report, a main aspect to include would be an evaluation of what did not go well, this should not be a main focussing point in a presentation, and you are also encouraged to show screenshots and code snippets of work you are particularly proud of. The following are some aspects that should be included in your presentations:

- Explanations
- Screenshots etc
- A high level overview
- What you learned
- What are you most proud of

### 7.3. What Does not Matter

Students often think that you have to be as professional as possible when presenting a report, such as wearing office clothing. However this is not the case, you are students and are not neccessarily expected to follow the same set of rules of someone working a full-time office job. The following are some aspects students often do, but do not need to be worried about when presenting their presentations:

- Wearing office clothing
- If you get lost or confused
- Being nervous:
  - everyone is
  - It won't affect your grade

### 7.4. Hints and Tips for Presentations

Here are a few hints and tips to help with your presentations:

- Fewer slides.
- More images.
- Fewer words on each slide.
- Don't read the slides.
- Speak slowly and clearly.
- Involve the audience - ask questions.
- If presenting in a group:
  - Let everyone speak.
  - Each prepare your own slides.
  - Use a single template.
  - Don't look bored when your colleagues are speaking.

## 8. Walkthroughs

Along with presentations, you are likely going to have to complete some walkthroughs throughout your course, especially at Levels 5 and 6. Both walkthroughs and presentations can be quite daunting for some students, however, they are nothing to be worried about and give you an opportunity to show off your product, particularly sections you are proud of creating.

Here are some aspects you should think about prior to completing a walkthrough:

- Preparation.
- Showing your work.
- How much detail.
- Answering questions.

Preparation is perhaps the most important aspect in this list. If you prepare well, chances are your walkthrough is going to run smoothly.

For both presentations and walkthroughs, it is ok to be nervous, everyone is, and it won't effect your grade. You also do not have to dress smart, like you would do in an office for example. If you are stuck for what to include in your presentations and reports, refer back to [What You Should Evaluate](#5-what-you-should-evaluate).

### 8.1. Preparation

You should take some time to prepare for your walkthroughs and demonstrations. Without proper preparation, you will likelt get lost, talk about aspects that you do not need to, or miss important details out.
The walkthrough is about showing off all the functionality of your product, so it is vitally important that you do not miss anything out.
The following should be considered:

- Have confidence
- Is there a script? (not always neccessary)
- Demo to a friend
- The machine (a laptop or a virtual machine in the cloud)

### 8.2. Hints and Tips for Walkthroughs

The following are some hints and tips for your walkthroughs; some that you may not have thought of previously.

### The Machine

Think about the following when chosing a machine for your walkthroughs:

- Have all infrastructure
- Install and test your own code
- If using a laptop make sure it is charged
- Use a lower than normal resolution
- Does it connect to SHU wifi?
- Do **NOT** think that you can set it up during the demo

### Have All Infrastructure

Make sure that you have all of the infrastructure:

- Installed
- Running
- What:
  - Libraries
  - Frameworks
  - Servers

### Install and Test Your Own Code

- The version that you submitted, even if you have updated it since (not recommended)
- If you have developed your code on your own machines, it is not guarenteed to work on University PC's. So make sure it does in advance.

### Use a Lower Than Normal Resolution

This is not an obvious one, however it can greatly help your tutor or client read and understand what is going on:

- Tutor will be viewing the screen at an angle
- Tutors want to be able to easily read the screen
- Switch to a more readable mode (i.e don't use a dark theme)
