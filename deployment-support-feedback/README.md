## 3. Why Evaluation Is Important

Evaluation is an often overlooked phase in the software lifecycle, however completing an evaluation can greatly improve the quality of the next product/project you are apart of.
Some of the benefits of evaluation include:

* Improves source code quality
* Improves communication and team work
* Clarifies outcomes
* Focuses attention of what went well, and what didn't go as well
* Supports ongoing learning
* Influences future developments

## 4. How You Will Be Assessed

Evaluation of your deliverable should not be overlooked. When you submit your deliverable, it is very likely that you will be asked to produce some form of evaluation of the product you submitted. This may take the form of one or more of the following:

* Reflective report
* Presentation
* Walkthrough

## 5. What You Should Evaluate

When undertaking your evaluation using any of the above, you should consider the following aspects:

* The solution:
  * How complete is it?
  * Does it work?
  * Is it maintainable?
  * Are you pleased with it?
  * Did you work well?
  * What problems did you encounter?
* User feedback
* Reflect and identify learning
* Refer back to:
  * Specification
  * The requirements you identified
  * Design decisions/models
  * Testing
* Your team:
  * Did you work well?
  * Did you encounter any problems?

## 6. What To Include In Your Reflective Report

Reflecting on the above, we expect you to evaluate the following in your reflective reports:

* Quality of the deliverable
* Assessment of your chosen methodologies
* Validation (refer to requirements, models, testing and user feedback)
* Discuss the case study in the context of your course (how you used knowledge you gained from the module and other modules)
* How well you worked as a team

## 7. What To Include In Your Presentations

Presentations are another popular form of assessment. You may need to complete a couple of these at Level 4. To help guide you with your presentations, the following should be included:

* Explanations
* Screenshots etc
* A high level overview
* What you learned
* What are you most proud of

### Hints and Tips for Presentations

Here are a few hints and tips to help with your presentations:

* Fewer slides
* More images
* Fewer words on each slide
* Don't read the slides
* Speak slowly and clearly
* Involve the audience - ask questions
* If presenting in a group:
	* Let everyone speak
	* Each prepare your own slides
	* Use a single template
	* Don't look bored when your colleagues are speaking

## 8. Walkthroughs

A long with presentations, you are likely going to have to complete at least one walkthrough at Level 4. Both walkthroughs and presentations can be quite daunting for some students, however, they are nothing to be worried about and give you an opportunity to show off your product, particularly sections you are proud of creating. Here are some aspects you should think about prior to completing a walkthrough:

* Preparation
* Showing your work
* How much detail
* Answering questions

Preparation is perhaps the most important aspect in this list. If you prepare well, chances are your walkthrough is going to run smoothly. 

For both presentations and walkthroughs, it is ok to be nervous, everyone is, and it won't effect your grade. You also do not have to dress smart, like you would do in an office for example. If you are stuck for what to include in your presentations and reports, refer back to [What You Should Evaluate](#5-what-you-should-evaluate).
