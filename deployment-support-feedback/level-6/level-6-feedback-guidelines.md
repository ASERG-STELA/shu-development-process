# Level 6 Support-Feedback Guidelines

## 1. Abstract

This document will go into detail about what is expected of Level 6 students for the final phase of the software development lifecycle, support and feedback from the deliverable. This includes evaluation and reflection of the decisions you have made throughout the development cycle. This is often in the form of a report, presentation or walkthrough. The basics of a good report are outlined in the [level 4](../level-4/level-4-feedback-guidelines.md) guidelines, and what should and shouldn't be included are outlined in the [level 5](../level-5/level-5-feedback-guidelines.md) guidelines.

## 3. What is Expected

We will not go into detail about what you should and shouldn't include, as this was covered in the [level 5](../level-5/level-5-feedback-guidelines.md) guidelines. Refer back to this, if you require some further guidance. 
Instead, we will explain what is expected from you.

At Level 6, we are expecting high quality written reports, presentations and walkthroughs:

Your reports, and presentations should be:

* Well structured and flow well, with as little spelling and gramatical errors as possible. 
* They should include most of the aspects covered in the Level 5 guidelines as well as any others that you deem appropriate. 
* It should also not be 'bloated' by anything coverd in the 'What not to Include' section, unless absolutely neccessary, such as to discuss a rather complicated section of code you are particularly proud of.

You should focus in particular on three important aspects:

* What went well?
* What didn't go well and why?
* What could be improved in future releases and how would you achieve this?
* How well does your end product meet the initial set of requirements you identified?

## 4. Tips for Writing Your Dissertation

The dissertation with your final year project will be the longest and most important report that you will have to complete on this course. Your dissertation should cover the entire software development lifecycle, from gathering requirements to evaluation and feedback. Although this is longer and involves more detail and research than your average report, the fundamental principles remain the same. To help you with this, we have put together some tips for writing your dissertation:

* Focus on structure, it is very important to have a well structured dissertation with a good flow. Some chapter headings could be:
  * Abstract
  * Acknowledgements
  * Introduction
  * Research
  * Design
  * Development
  * Testing
  * Evaluation
* You should write around 8000 words +- 10%. If you go over 10,000, it is likely you are waffling. The abstract or synopsis should not exceed 300 words
* You can write your report as you are going along, or after you have finished development, but make sure it is up to date (figures, information etc).
* Look at previous example reports from previous final year students (on Blackboard).
* Check the project handbook provided if you need any clarity. This should be your first point of information.
* Use APA referencing. It is important to find a wide range of references from a variety of sources (books, research papers, websites etc).
* If you are including designs such as Personas and Scenarios, include them as appendices (which do not go towards the word count). Make sure all appendices are referenced at some point in the text.
* Use 10 point line spacing (1.5 in word), with a font size of 11.
* Use decimal system for numbering sections e.g. (3.2.1).
* Figures should be numbered and have a title.
* Try to make an impact in your introduction. If you manage to grip the reader early on, it is likely they will be more interested for the rest of your dissertation.
