# Level 5 Support-Feedback Guidelines

## 1. Abstract

This document will go into detail about what is expected of Level 5 students for the final phase of the software development lifecycle, support and feedback from the deliverable. This includes evaluation and reflection of the decisions you have made throughout the development cycle. This is often in the form of a report, presentation or walkthrough.
The basics of a good report are outlined in the [level 4](../level-4/level_4_feedback_guidelines.md) guidelines, we will go into more detail about what makes a good report in this document.

## 3. Aspects of a Good Report

A report is likely to be the most common form of evaluation/feedback assessment that you will encounter on this course. It is important to know what makes a good report, and the aspects that you should consider when writing your report.

There are three main aspects that you should consider when writing a report:

* Structure
* What to Include
* What not to Include

## 3.1. Structure

A good report not only relies on what goes into it, it is also important to think about the structure of it. Your report should be a joy to read, and should captivate the reader from the first couple of sections. 
It should follow a clean, and well structured approach, with as little grammatical errors as possible. The following are a selection of headers that you should cover in your report. Your report does not neccessarily have to follow this exact structure, but it should give you some idea for what the structure of your project should look like:

* Abstract
* Introduction
* Design
* Implementation and Testing
* Evaluation
* References
* Appendices: 
	* Screenshots
	* Design Documents

## 3.2. What to Include

Along with a solid, well built structure, you also need to know what you should include in your report. This should go hand in hand with the structure, and you should not stray away from your structure while writing your report. 
Thinking about what to include in your report will be important in ensuring that you are on the right track with your development, and will assist you reaching the minimum word count. Here are some important aspects that you should consider including in your report:

* Explanations of why you did things
* Your development process (design, implementation, testing etc)
* Your reflections and learning:
	* Your main achievements (what went well)
	* What could have been done better
* A management-level overview of your work

## 3.3. What not to Include

As well as what to include, it is also important to consider what you do not need to include in a report. This will reduce 'bloating' your report with unneccessary content which will keep your word count down and your report more concise. It will also ensure that you do not get side-tracked and begin talking about stuff that you do not need to as well as hemp keep your readers attention.
Here are two important details **NOT** to include in your report:

* Source code
* Details of every iteration that you went through

Source code may be acceptable if you are showing off or explaining a particular piece of code that you are proud off, however if you chose to do this, make sure that:

* If showing a screenshot, make sure you are not using a 'dark' theme in the code editor, this takes the readers' eye towards the image rather than the actual writing about why you are showing it
* If you copy the code directly, only copy a very small section of it, as it will bloat your report with unneccessary extra words. Also make sure it is formatted well, or else it will look messy.

If you can just explain the section of code without actually showing it, this would be much better than adding in the code directly or as a screenshot.
