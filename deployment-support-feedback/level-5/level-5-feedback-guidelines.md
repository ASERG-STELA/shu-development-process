# Level 5 Support-Feedback Guidelines

## 1. Abstract

This document will go into detail about what is expected of Level 5 students for the final phase of the software development lifecycle, support and feedback from the deliverable. This includes evaluation and reflection of the decisions you have made throughout the development cycle. This is often in the form of a report, presentation or walkthrough. The basics of a good report are outlined in the [level 4](../level-4/level-4-feedback-guidelines.md) guidelines, we will go into more detail about what makes a good report in this document, as well as what makes good presentations, and walkthroughs.

## 3. Reporting

## 3.1. Aspects of a Good Report

A report is likely to be the most common form of evaluation/feedback assessment that you will encounter on this course. It is important to know what makes a good report, and the aspects that you should consider when writing your report.

There are three main aspects that you should consider when writing a report:

* Structure
* What to Include
* What not to Include

## 3.2. Structure

A good report not only relies on what goes into it, it is also important to think about the structure of it. Your report should be a joy to read, and should captivate the reader from the first couple of sections. 
It should follow a clean, and well structured approach, with as little grammatical errors as possible. The following are a selection of headers that you should cover in your report. Your report does not neccessarily have to follow this exact structure, but it should give you some idea for what the structure of your project should look like:

* Abstract
* Introduction
* Design
* Implementation and Testing
* Evaluation
* References
* Appendices: 
	* Screenshots
	* Design Documents

## 3.3. What to Include

Along with a solid, well built structure, you also need to know what you should include in your report. This should go hand in hand with the structure, and you should not stray away from your structure while writing your report. 
Thinking about what to include in your report will be important in ensuring that you are on the right track with your development, and will assist you reaching the minimum word count. Here are some important aspects that you should consider including in your report:

* Explanations of why you did things
* Your development process (design, implementation, testing etc)
* Your reflections and learning:
	* Your main achievements (what went well)
	* What could have been done better
* A management-level overview of your work

## 3.4. What not to Include

As well as what to include, it is also important to consider what you do not need to include in a report. This will reduce 'bloating' your report with unneccessary content which will keep your word count down and your report more concise. It will also ensure that you do not get side-tracked and begin talking about stuff that you do not need to as well as hemp keep your readers attention.
Here are two important details **NOT** to include in your report:

* Source code
* Details of every iteration that you went through

Source code may be acceptable if you are showing off or explaining a particular piece of code that you are proud off, however if you chose to do this, make sure that:

* If showing a screenshot, make sure you are not using a 'dark' theme in the code editor, this takes the readers' eye towards the image rather than the actual writing about why you are showing it
* If you copy the code directly, only copy a very small section of it, as it will bloat your report with unneccessary extra words. Also make sure it is formatted well, or else it will look messy.

If you can just explain the section of code without actually showing it, this would be much better than adding in the code directly or as a screenshot.

## 4. Presentations

## 4.1. Aspects of a good Presentation

Presentations are another popular form of assessment for feedback, you will likely have to do a few of these throughout your course. Presentations are usually created on PowerPoint or similar software, then presented as an individual or group to a client. Like a written report, you should consider these three important aspects:

* Structure
* What to include
* What not to include

## 4.2. Structure

As with a written report, is is important to have a clear structure and flow to your presentations. A presentation that does not flow well will likely be hard to present, and will sound messy and ill-considered. As guidance, The following structure aspects could be considered when creating/presenting a presentation. You do not have to use this structure exactly, but it should give you an idea of what we are looking for:

* Brief introduction to yourselves
* Your understanding of the problem
* Your approach to the problem
* Software architecture
* Data and database
* The design of the interface

## 4.3. What to Include

A presentation is about showing off your work, and you should aim to do just that. In a written report, a main aspect to include would be an evaluation of what did not go well, this should not be a main focussing point in a presentation, and you are also encouraged to show screenshots and code snippets of work you are particularly proud of. The following are some aspects that should be included in your presentations:

* Explanations
* Screenshots etc
* A high level overview
* What you learned
* What are you most proud of

## 4.4. What Does Not Matter

Students often think that you have to be as professional as possible when presenting a report, such as wearing office clothing. However this is not the case, you are students and are not neccessarily expected to follow the same set of rules of someone working a full-time office job. The following are some aspects students often do, but do not need to be worried about when presenting their presentations:

* Wearing office clothing
* If you get lost or confused
* Being nervous:
	* everyone is
	* It won't affect your grade

## 4.5. Some Hints and Tips

Here are some hints and tips to help you with your presentations:

* Fewer slides
* More images
* Fewer words on each slide
* Don't read the slides
* Speak slowly and clearly
* Involve the audience - ask questions
* If presenting in a group:
	* Let everyone speak
	* Each prepare your own slides
	* Use a single template
	* Don't look bored when your colleagues are speaking

## 5. Walkthroughs and Demonstrations

Walkthroughs and demonstrations are another popular assassment technique you will encounter on your course. You will have to do a walkthrough to your clients for your GSDP projects, so it important you know what to talk about, and what to show off.

During a walkthrough, you should be thinking about the following:

* Preparation
* Showing your work
* How much detail
* Answering questions

### 5.1. Preparation

You should take some time to prepare for your walkthroughs and demonstrations. Without proper preparation, you will likelt get lost, talk about aspects that you do not need to, or miss important details out. The walkthrough is about showing off all the functionality of your product, so it is vitally important that you do not miss anything out.
The following should be considered:

* Have confidence
* Is there a script? (not always neccessary)
* Demo to a friend
* The laptop

### 5.2. Hints and Tips

The following are some hints and tips for your walkthroughs; some that you may not have thought of previously. 

### The Laptop

Think about the following when chosing a laptop for your walkthroughs:

* Have all infrastructure
* Install and test your own code
* Make sure it is charged
* Use a lower than normal resolution
* Does it connect to SHU wifi?
* Do **NOT** think that you can set it up during the demo

### Have All Infrastructure

Make sure that you have all of the infrastructure:

* Installed
* Running
* What:
	* Libraries
	* Frameworks
	* Servers

### Install and Test Your Own Code

* The version that you submitted, even if you have updated it since (not recommended)
* If you have developed your code on your own machines, it is not guarenteed to work on University PC's. So make sure it does in advance.

### Use a Lower Than Normal Resolution

This is not an obvious one, however it can greatly help your tutor or client read and understand what is going on:

* Tutor will be viewing the screen at an angle
* Tutors want to be able to easily read the screen
* Switch to a more readable mode (i.e don't use a dark theme)
