# Level 5 Support-Feedback Guidelines

## 1. Abstract

This document will go into detail about what is expected of Level 5 students for the final phase of the software development lifecycle, support and feedback from the deliverable. This includes evaluation and reflection of the decisions you have made throughout the development cycle. This is often in the form of a report, presentation or walkthrough. General guidance on what makes a good report, presentation and walkthrough are detailed in the main [README file](../README.md). In this document, we will go into more detail about the reports that you will encounter in your GSDP module, including what is expected of you.

## 3. What You Will Encounter

Your GSDP module is one of the most important modules on your course. It will provide you with real world experience, allowing you to work with a real client on a real project. Some of your work may have the chance of actually being implemented by your client. Over the course of the module, you will be assessed on three areas:

* Preparation report (15%).
* Scrum week performance and deliverable (70%).
* Post Scrum week reflective report and screencast (15%).

Two of the three aspects above involve writing a report. We will be focussing on these two over the next few sections.

## 4. Preparation report

Your preparation report is worth 15% of the module, and will be the first piece of work you will produce that will be assessed. As the wording suggests, this report is written before you begin development. You may think that this initial report will not greatly contribute to the project, however you will find that if you produce a high quality preparation report, you will identify and solve some key issues before they even become issues at all. This will result in a much smoother development experience.

The task consists of a written report of no more than 1500 words. It is designed to assess your preparedness for the first Scrum week.

In this report, you should address the following:

* Project specification critique (50 marks).
* Software development process and supporting tools (30 marks).
* Resource management (20 marks).

## 5. Post Scrum Week Reflective Report

This report will be conducted after the first Scrum week. It consists of 1000 words and a screencast of no more than 5 minutes. 
In this report, you will need to reflect on your performance on the first Scrum week, witht the hope that it will help you improve on some areas for the second Scrum week.

You should discuss the following in this report:

* Software development process and tools (40 marks).
* Critique of the application (20 marks).

Remember, if you are struggling to think of things to talk about, refer back to the mark scheme and the general guidance outlined in the main [README file](../README.md).
