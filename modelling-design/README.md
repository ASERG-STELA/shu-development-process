## 1. Introduction

The design step is focused on the modelling of the solution.
It usually involves decision around architecture, data structure, user-interface, classes, algorithms, etc. The following will be covered:

- Techniques
  - Formal Diagrams
    - Class
    - Interaction/Sequence
  - Wireframes
  - Ad Hoc Drawing
  - Mindmaps
  - Lists  
- Finding what works for you
  - Capturing Ideas
  - Communicating
  - Revising
  - Tracking History
- Designing the
  - Architecture
  - Database
  - User Interface (UI)  

## 2. Level Specific Guidance

### [Level 4](level-4/level4-design.md)

- Software models: Basic class diagram, entity relationship diagram, sequence diagram. Class diagram and sequence diagram should be linked well.

### [Level 5](level-5/level5-design.md)

- Software architecture: Nice to have based on the nature of the module. For example, GSDP can have Architecture Overview, NSD need not.
- Software models: Detailed class diagram, entity relationship diagram, sequence diagram with proper annotation. All diagrams should be in sync.

### [Level 6](level-6/level6-design.md)

- Software architecture: System context and architecture overview.
- Software models: Static model, dynamic model with proper documentation. Models should be fully consistent.
- End to end traceability (Requirement Traceability Verification Matrix) need to be maintained.
